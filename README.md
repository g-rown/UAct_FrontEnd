  The **UAct - Community Service Tracking System** is a digital platform designed to streamline and modernize the way Community Service requirements are monitored for college students at the University of the Assumption. The system provides an organized and efficient approach to tracking each student's required service hours, ensuring that both students and administrators have accurate, real-time information.

  This system allows students to view their applied programs, submit logs of completed service activities, and monitor their remaining hours. Meanwhile, school administrators can manage service programs, review student submissions, and approve or deny completed hours.

  By automating the tracking and validation of community service hours, the system minimizes manual workload, reduces errors, and enhances accountability. It also ensures that the university’s community engagement initiatives are properly documented and aligned with institutional requirements.
